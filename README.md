## About Me

I am a transgender programmer 🏳️‍⚧️, currently learning the world of C#. My journey in programming started with Lua, specifically in Roblox Studio. Programming is like an adventure, especially when I'm figuring out how to fix things when they go wrong (Probably just missing a semicolon). I love playing games and learning how they work!

## Current Endeavors

- 🔭 Honing my C# skills by developing game plugins using [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony)
- 🌱 Enjoying outdoor activities (touching grass) and quality time with my friends.
- 👯 Open to collaborating on projects, especially those that are beginner-friendly or related to game development.
