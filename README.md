# Hi there, I'm Aster o7 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewars.com/users/UVAster/"><img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/UVAster/badges/micro"></a>

I am a transgender programmer 🏳️‍⚧️, and my pronouns are [she/they](https://en.pronouns.page/she%26they).
I started my programming journey with Lua, specifically in Roblox Studio, and fell in love with the concept of being able to solve problems with code. All of my personal code is going to be open sourced and licensed under either [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) or [a GNU License](www.gnu.org/licenses/)

## Current Endeavors
