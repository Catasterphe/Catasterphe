# Hi there, I'm Aster o7 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewars.com/users/UVAster/"><img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/UVAster/badges/micro"></a>

I am a transgender programmer 🏳️‍⚧️, and my pronouns are [she/they](https://en.pronouns.page/she%26they). Doing whatever they say developers do? I started with Lua, specifically in Roblox Studio, and fell in love with the concept of Programming and solving problems. Errors are like a short horror film, until the compiler tells me that my code is just missing a semicolon.
